		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I'm Steve! I currently live in De Pere, Wisconsin with my wife, Ally, and my two pets: dog Tucker and cat Apollo. Although I spend most of my time at work or at school, I enjoy several hobbies when I'm not busy with one of those. I am currently involved with St Norbert College's community band as a percussionist, and I enjoy making and playing music besides that. I have been a percussionist since sixth grade and have also played piano and guitar since I was a child. Since the time in high school when I started having an income I have accumulated more instruments as well. Whether that is a mandolin, a tenor saxophone, an accordion, a recorder (a quality wooden one, not the plastic ones played in grade school), or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xaphoon">xaphoon</a>, I love collecting and having a variety of instruments at my disposal.</p>
		<p>My wife and I also love traveling as much as we can. Since we have been together, we have taken road trips to Indianapolis, Colorado and Toronto, and have gone to London and northeastern Germany (as one trip), Belize, and Puerto Rico. Presently, we're hoping our next trip takes us back to Germany, albeit this time to the west near Frankfurt, and we have dreams of going to many more places around the world.</p>
		<p>I'm also (when time allows) an avid video gamer, having been a part of every console generation since I've been born. Although I don't have as much time to play anymore, I still love keeping up with what's going on by following the news, listening to podcasts, and watching Youtubers.</p>
